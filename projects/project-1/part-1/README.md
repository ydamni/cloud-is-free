## What the project is about

Through this project, you will be able to host a static website on AWS.
Along the way, you will learn how to:
- Import a domain name on AWS;
- Create a hosted zone and manage its DNS records;
- Create S3 Buckets to host website pages;
- Configure Route 53 to link the domain name to the website;
- Create an SSL certificate for the website using AWS Certificate Manager (ACM);
- Create CloudFront distributions to secure the website in HTTPS.
